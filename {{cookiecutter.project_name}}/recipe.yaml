# `recipe.yaml` is the main configuration file for an MLflow Recipe.
# Required recipe parameters should be defined in this file with either concrete values or
# variables such as {%raw-%}{{ INGEST_DATA_LOCATION }}.{%endraw%}

# Variables must be dereferenced in a profile YAML file, located under `profiles/`.
# See `profiles/local.yaml` for example usage. One may switch among profiles quickly by
# providing a profile name such as `local` in the Recipe object constructor:
# `r = Recipe(profile="local")`
#
# NOTE: YAML does not support tabs for indentation. Please use spaces and ensure that all YAML
# files are properly formatted.
