# CI/CD Workflow Definitions
This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines/),
under ``devops-pipelines``. These workflows cover testing and deployment of both ML code (for model training, batch inference, etc) and the 
Databricks ML resource definitions under ``{{template `project_name_alphanumeric_underscore` .}}/resources``. 

To set up CI/CD for a new project,
please refer to [ML resource config - set up CI CD](../../{{template `project_name_alphanumeric_underscore` .}}/resources/README.md#set-up-ci-and-cd).
