# CI/CD Workflow Definitions
This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines),
under ``devops-pipelines``. These workflows cover testing and deployment of both ML code (for model training, batch inference, etc) and 
Databricks ML resource definitions. 

To set up CI/CD for a new project,
please refer to [Setting up CI/CD](<../../README.md#Setting up CI/CD>) and following the [MLOps Setup Guide](../../docs/mlops-setup.md).
